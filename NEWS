# bit64 4.5.99 (in development)

## NOTES

1. After creating, developing, and maintaining {bit64} for about 13 years, Jens Oehlschl√§gel has decided to step down as maintainer of the package. Michael Chirico will take over in this duty. Thank you Jens for creating such a wonderful & important part of the R ecosystem!

  I don't have any major plans for new features, and mostly hope to keep the package running and up to date. Contributors most welcome! I am also trying to freshen up the code base to make contribution easier.

1. The R version dependency has increased from 3.0.1 (May 2013) to 3.3.0 (April 2017). We plan to keep roughly the same R dependency as {data.table}, i.e., as old as possibly for as long as possible, with some bias towards gradually bringing in new R features to reduce the maintenance overhead of a growing nest of workarounds to keep the package "fresh" for users of the latest R versions.

1. Default packages {methods}, {stats}, and {utils} are now `Imports:`, not `Depends:`, dependencies. `Depends:` is an out-dated mode of dependency in R. This will only affect the small audience of users that run R with `R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=NULL` (or some other subset excluding some of these three), _and_ who are relying (perhaps implicitly) on {bit64} being responsible for attaching those packages.

  It is my intention to move {bit} from `Depends:` to `Imports:` as well, but this migration will be done more gingerly -- it is more conceivable that this will constitute a breaking change for some use cases, therefore it will be done in phases. Nothing is done in this release, but here is your earliest warning that from the next release, it will be a warning to rely on {bit64} to attach {bit} functions for you.

1. Package documentation is now managed with {roxygen2}, #61. I tried to retain everything in the original documentation, but the diff required to do so was quite unmanageable (5,000+ lines), so please alert me if anything looks amiss. Most importantly, I ensured the NAMESPACE remains unchanged.

1. The signature of `identical.integer64()` loses `extptr.as.ref=`, which is unavailable for R<4.2.0, but gains `...` to allow this argument in newer versions, #37. This retains the transparency of having all arguments named in the signature (and thus in `?identical.integer64` as well as available for tab-completion) while also retaining the old R version dependency R 3.3.0.

# bit64 NEWS for versions 0.8-3 through 4.5.2 are now in [NEWS.0](https://github.com/r-lib/bit64/blob/master/NEWS.0)
