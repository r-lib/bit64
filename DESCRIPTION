Description: 
 Package 'bit64' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers 
 that can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames. Methods are 
 available for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles, characters 
 and factors as well as many elementwise and summary functions. Many fast 
 algorithmic operations such as 'match' and 'order' support interactive data
 exploration and manipulation and optionally leverage caching.
